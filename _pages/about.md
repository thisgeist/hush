title: "About Me"
---

I am writing a novel. About love in its many very forms.

(Itâ€™s actually about My Favourite Trio - because Iâ€™m biased and made them that way.)

Spoilers:
Andrew doesnâ€™t understand human.
Nile wants to know EVERYTHING.
Alyssa just wishes she could eat an avocado toast in peace.

This is not a love triangle
...
...
...
...OR IS IT?

My aim is to write an original novel where its fanfiction can be commercialised and celebrated.

Previous generations of fan creators have been raising me for a long time.

This is my promise to you.

This writer loves you and is trying her very best to give back to the world that loves her.

Despite the empty wallet, fan creators reached out through the fog of gaslighting despair and rescued me.

Youâ€™ve shown me the stars, taken me over to a thousand figurative multiverses, and let me know from somewhereâ€”somehow that even in my darkest days, I was not alone.

Iâ€™m only hoping to bring you back a galaxy.
