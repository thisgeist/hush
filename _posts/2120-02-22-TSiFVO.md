All characters appearing in this work

are

FICTITIOUS.

Any resemblance 

to 

anything real

(events: 

past, present, or future;

persons: 

living, dead, or status unknown)

is

sincerely,

obviously,

genuinely,

purely

coincidental.

(If your name happened to match that of my character, 

CONGRATULATIONS!

For having a pretty dope name.

My characters have really cool initials though ðŸ˜‰ )

All the love, DS
